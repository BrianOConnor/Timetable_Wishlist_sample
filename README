Attached are two files, WishlistClone.js and WishlistClone.php. These files contain the code 
that I added/modified to Wishlist.js and Wishlist.php for the Timetable Whiz tool found at at.eng.carleton.ca/engsched (Timetable Whiz tab). 

The two files included display the code behind the functionality that generates the timetables. The files included are shorter versions 
of the code on Wishlist.js and Wishlist.php because they leave out the parts that involve generating the dropdown menus, which would make 
both files considerably longer. 

The Timetable Whiz tool had been built prior to my time working on it, but was not functioning properly. Thus I basically rewrote the timetable
generation functionality from scratch, and modified numerous other parts of the code. 

To begin, start with WishlistClone.js which contains the majority of the functionality. WishlistClone.php contains the server-side retreival of
information from the database.
